Julian Date
==========

This is a full webapp that will display the current Julian Date* of the year. It works fine on a desktop, but is full yoptimized for mobile. It was a quick app that I can use at the store while buying eggs (I like my eggs fresh).

The live example can be found here: http://catdad.github.io/JulianDate/

_* Julian Date is somewhat a misnomer here. This app actually displays the ordinal date; however, it is commonly called Julia date when it is talked aobut, so I went ahead and used the name anyway._
